Basic usage
The above is already sufficient to use git in a distributed and secure way, provided users have access to the machine assuming the server role via SSH. On the server machine, creating a new repository can be done with:

git init --bare /path/to/repository
This creates a bare repository, that cannot be used to edit files directly. If you would rather have a working copy of the contents of the repository on the server, ommit the --bare option.

Any client with SSH access to the machine can then clone the repository with:

git clone username@hostname:/path/to/repository
Once cloned to the client's machine, the client can edit files, then commit and share them with:

cd /path/to/repository
#(edit some files
git commit -a # Commit all changes to the local version of the repository
git push origin master # Push changes to the server's version of the repository
